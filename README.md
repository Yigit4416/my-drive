- [ ] setup S3
- [ ] put some files to S3 and test UI
- [ ] look for how to show users pdf or excel files
- [ ] make sure that uploading will be at client side not on server
- [ ] make it shareable if user wants
- [ ] if elements on breadcrumb more than 4 show other elements in "..." dropdown element

## NOTES


- share link will be route of file
- Copy button doesn't functioning propperly (after connecting with S3 this will be contain link we want)
- drawer.tsx might give error because DialogTitle.
- Rather than breadcrumb you can use side bar with scroll area so you don't have to worry about size of route
